# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## AirBnB Clone Project - Backend and Command-Line Interface

This initial phase of the AirBnB clone project focuses on developing the backend infrastructure and integrating it with a console application using Python's cmd module. Python objects generated during user interactions are stored in a JSON file, accessible through the json module.

### Command-Line Interface

The application's interface resembles the Bash shell, but with a restricted set of commands specifically tailored for AirBnB website operations. This command-line interpreter serves as the web app's frontend, enabling users to interact with the backend built using Python's object-oriented programming principles.

Available commands include:

- `create`
- `show`
- `count`
- `update`
- `destroy`

### User Functionality

Leveraging the command-line interpreter, backend, and file storage system, users can perform various actions:

- Create new objects
- Retrieve objects from files or databases
- Perform operations on objects, such as computing statistics
- Update object attributes
- Delete objects
